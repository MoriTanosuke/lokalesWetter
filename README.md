Local weather
=============
This is my first [Alexa skill][0] implemented in Javascript and running on [AWS Lambda][1]. It's based on the NodeJS example and queries openweathermap.org for the current weather.

NOTE: Currently the location is hardcoded.

--------------

This skill does only store data to query openweathermap.org. No data is kept after the request is served.
